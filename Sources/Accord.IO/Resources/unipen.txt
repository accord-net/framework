.COMMENT		C - RESERVED STRING GLOSSARY
			    ------------------------
(data types are also reserved, see section I)

.RESERVE [N]-[N],[N]	      		Compact representation of a list of 
					numbers, used by .LEXICON_SET, 
					.SEGMENT, .REC_TIME, .REC_LABELS, 
					.REC_SCORES. The list:
 					2, 3, 4, 5, 15, 9, 50, 51, 52 ,53,
					54, 55 would be represented as:
					2-5,15,9,50-55.
					Commas allow non contiguous numbers
					(useful for segmentation of delayed
					strokes, i dots and t bars). 
					NO SPACES are allowed in the notation.
.RESERVE [A[:M]]-[B[:N]],[C]		More flexible representation to 
					delineate segments of data
					by breaking components. A,B and C are 
					component numbers, M and N are point 
					numbers in the component. 
					Both components and points are 0-base.
					L defaults to zero and M to the last 
					point in the component. Thus the
					[N]-[N],[N] expressions are special 
					cases of a [A[:M]]-[B[:N]],[C] 
					expression. The example
					1:40-3,5,6:0-6:12 delineates component 
					1 from point 40 to the end,
					all of component 2, 3 and 5 and
					component 6 from the beginning to
					point 12.
					NO SPACES are allowed in the notation.
.RESERVE X				X position of the pen on the pad 
					surface, in units of X given by 
					.X_POINTS_PER_INCH
.RESERVE Y				Y position of the pen on the pad 
					surface, in units of Y given by 
					.Y_POINTS_PER_INCH
.RESERVE T				Time in MILLISECONDS.
.RESERVE P				Pressure in units of P given by 
					.UNITS_PER_GRAM. Use preferably a 
					linearized pressure in 1000 units 
					per gram of force and calibrate the
					zero as the threshold of pen reaching
					the pad surface. Negative pressures
					can account for remaining non-
					linearities and hysteresis.
.RESERVE Z				Altitude above the pad surface, in 
					units of Z given by .Z_POINTS_PER_INCH.
.RESERVE BUTTON				Barrel button states: 0, 1, ...
.RESERVE RHO				Rotational angle of the stylus, 
					measured in degrees from some
					nominal orientation of the stylus 
					(e. g. barrel button on top).
					The angle increases with clockwise 
					rotation as seen from the rear 
					end of the stylus.
.RESERVE THETA				XY angle of the stylus, measured in 
					degrees, increasing from the X axis
					in the counter-clockwise direction.
.RESERVE PHI				Z angle of the stylus, increasing 
					from the pad surface,
					in the positive Z direction.
.RESERVE L				Left handed.
.RESERVE R				Right handed.
.RESERVE M				Male.
.RESERVE F				Female.         
.RESERVE BAD				Unskilled writer, illegible writing.
.RESERVE OK				Average quality writing, unambiguously
					legible.
.RESERVE GOOD				Superior quality writing, most 
					recognizers should get it.
.RESERVE ?				Unknown.
.RESERVE PRINTED			Printed handwriting style.
.RESERVE CURSIVE			Cursive handwriting style.
.RESERVE MIXED				Mixed printed and cursive handwriting
					style.
.RESERVE ACCEPT				Accepted by recognizer.
.RESERVE REJECT				Rejected by recognizer.
