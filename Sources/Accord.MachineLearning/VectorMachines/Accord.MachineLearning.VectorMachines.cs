    ///   This namespace contains both standard <see cref="SupportVectorMachine"/>s and the
    ///   kernel extension given by <see cref="KernelSupportVectorMachine"/>s. For multiple
    ///   classes or categories, the framework offers <see cref="MulticlassSupportVectorMachine"/>s
    ///   and <see cref="MultilabelSupportVectorMachine"/>s. Multi-class machines can be used for
    ///   cases where a single class should be picked up from a list of several class labels, and
    ///   the multi-label machine for cases where multiple class labels might be detected for a 
    ///   single input vector. The multi-class machines also support two types of classification:
    ///   the faster decision based on Decision Directed Acyclic Graphs, and the more traditional
    ///   based on a Voting scheme.</para>

    /// <para>
    ///   Learning can be achieved using the standard <see cref="SequentialMinimalOptimization"/>

    ///   using <see cref="ProbabilisticOutputCalibration"/>. A <see cref="Accord.Statistics.Kernels">
