    ///   based on Genetic Algorithms (GA), Genetic Programming (GP) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP).

    ///   <item>
    ///     Collection of fitness functions' classes implementing IFitnessFunction interface, which are used to evaluate chromosomes by calculating their fitness values for different tasks;</item>
