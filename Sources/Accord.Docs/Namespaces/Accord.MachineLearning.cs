    ///   Without question, the most popular models available in this namespace are the <see
    ///   cref="Accord.MachineLearning.VectorMachines">Support Vector Machines</see>. The inner
    ///   VectorMachines namespace contains both standard <see cref="SupportVectorMachine"/>s and
    ///   their kernel extension given by <see cref="KernelSupportVectorMachine"/>s. For multiple
    ///   classes or categories, the framework also offers <see cref="MulticlassSupportVectorMachine"/>s
    ///   and <see cref="MultilabelSupportVectorMachine"/>s. Multi-class machines can be used for
    ///   cases where a single class should be picked up from a list of several class labels, and
    ///   the multi-label machine for cases where multiple class labels might be detected for a 
    ///   single input vector. The multi-class machines also support two types of classification:
    ///   the faster decision based on Decision Directed Acyclic Graphs, and the more traditional
    ///   based on a Voting scheme.</para>
    ///   
    /// <para>
    ///   Still talking about SVMs, the framework offers several methods to learn and train those
    ///   machines. While the most popular method will always be the <see cref="SequentialMinimalOptimization"/>
    ///   (SMO) algorithm, the framework can also learn Least Squares SVMs (LS-SVMs) using <see 
    ///   cref="LeastSquaresLearning"/>, and even calibrate SVMs to produce probabilistic outputs
    ///   using <see cref="ProbabilisticOutputCalibration"/>. A <see cref="Accord.Statistics.Kernels">
    ///   huge variety of kernels functions is available in the statistics namespace</see>, and
    ///   new kernels can be created easily using the <see cref="IKernel"/> interface.</para>
    ///   
    /// <para>
    ///   Besides SVMs, this namespace includes <see cref="Accord.MachineLearning.Bayes">Naïve Bayes</see>,

    ///   <see cref="Accord.MachineLearning.Boosting">Boosting methods</see>,
    ///   <see cref="IClusteringAlgorithm{T}">Clustering techniques</see>, and other
