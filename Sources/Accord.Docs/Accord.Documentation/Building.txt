Building the documentation
==========================

In order to build the documentation project of Accord.NET,
a few requisite programs should be previously installed:


 - Sandcastle Help File Builder (SHFB)
   http://shfb.codeplex.com/


Note: The guided SHFB installer should install all 
other dependencies (such as Sandcastle) automatically.
