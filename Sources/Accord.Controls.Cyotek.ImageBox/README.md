# Cyotek ImageBox Control

## About
The `ImageBox` is a lightweight owner drawn control for displaying images. It supports zooming, scrolling, panning, region selection and much more! In addition to the traditional mode of binding to an `Image`, you can also use a *virtual mode*, and provide your own custom drawing whilst retaining all the `ImageBox` functionality. 

The `ImageBox` control also provides convenient helper methods for translating points, rectangles and sizes according to the current zoom level and scroll position of the control - this makes it easy to scale custom drawing to fit the control.

As well as the different behaviours offered, the `ImageBox` also supports a large number of display properties. The background of the control can display a solid colour, or a coloured grid in various sizes. You can also configure how the grid is to be drawn, for example just around the image bounds, or the full control bounds. Other options include the pixel grid, which is displayed when zooming in on an image to highlight each pixel, custom border styles for surrounding the image, and many other properties. You can also display text, and specifying formatting and alignment options.
