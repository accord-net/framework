    /// <remarks><para>The interface defines set of methods, which should be implemented
    /// by shape optimizing algorithms. These algorithms take input shape, which is defined
    /// by a set of points (corners of convex hull, etc.), and remove some insignificant points from it,
    /// which has little influence on the final shape's look.</para>
    /// 
    /// <para>The shape optimizing algorithms can be useful in conjunction with such algorithms
    /// like convex hull searching, which usually may provide many hull points, where some
    /// of them are insignificant and could be removed.</para>

    /// <para>For additional details about shape optimizing algorithms, documentation of
    /// particular algorithm should be studied.</para>
