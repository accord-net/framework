    ///   Taxicab geometry, considered by Hermann Minkowski in 19th century Germany, 
    ///   is a form of geometry in which the usual distance function of metric or
    ///   Euclidean geometry is replaced by a new metric in which the distance between 
    ///   two points is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian 
    ///   coordinates. The taxicab metric is also known as rectilinear distance, L1 
    ///   distance or L1 norm (see Lp space), city block distance, Manhattan distance,
    ///   or Manhattan length, with corresponding variations in the name of the geometry.
    ///   The latter names allude to the grid layout of most streets on the island of 
    ///   Manhattan, which causes the shortest path a car could take between two intersections
    ///   in the borough to have length equal to the intersections' distance in taxicab
