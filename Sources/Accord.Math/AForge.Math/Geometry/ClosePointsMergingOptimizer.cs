    /// mean coordinates of the removed points.</para>

    /// while it goes through a shape, it may merge several points (more than 2) into a
    /// single point, where distance between extreme points may be bigger
    /// than the <see cref="MaxDistanceToMerge">specified limit</see>. For example, suppose
    /// a case with 3 points, where 1st and 2nd points are close enough to be merged, but the
    /// 3rd point is a little bit further. During merging of 1st and 2nd points, it may
