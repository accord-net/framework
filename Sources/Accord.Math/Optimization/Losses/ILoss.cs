    ///   In mathematical optimization, statistics, decision theory and machine learning, a loss 
    ///   function or cost function is a function that maps an event or values of one or more 
    ///   variables onto a real number intuitively representing some "cost" associated with the 
    ///   event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. An objective function
    ///   is either a loss function or its negative (sometimes called a reward function, a profit
    ///   function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be
    ///   maximized.</para>
