    ///   In statistics, the sign test can be used to test the hypothesis that the difference
    ///   median is zero between the continuous distributions of two random variables X and Y,
    ///   in the situation when we can draw paired samples from X and Y. It is a non-parametric
    ///   test which makes very few assumptions about the nature of the distributions under test
    ///   - this means that it has very general applicability but may lack the <see cref="Accord.Statistics.Testing.Power">
    ///   statistical power</see> of other tests such as the <see cref="PairedTTest">paired-samples
