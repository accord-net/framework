    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    ///   The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test tries to determine if a sample differs significantly
    ///   from an hypothesized theoretical probability distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov
    ///   test has an interesting advantage in which it does not requires any assumptions
    ///   about the data. The distribution of the K-S test statistic does not depend on
    ///   which distribution is being tested.</para>
    /// <para>
    ///   The K-S test has also the advantage of being an exact test (other tests, such as the
    ///   chi-square goodness-of-fit test depends on an adequate sample size). One disadvantage
    ///   is that it requires a fully defined distribution which should not have been estimated
    ///   from the data. If the parameters of the theoretical distribution have been estimated
    ///   from the data, the critical region of the K-S test will be no longer valid.</para>
    /// <para>
