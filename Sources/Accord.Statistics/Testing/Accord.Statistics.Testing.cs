    ///   This namespace contains a suite of parametric and non-parametric hypothesis tests. Every
    ///   test in this library implements the <see cref="IHypothesisTest"/> interface, which defines
    ///   a few <see cref="IHypothesisTest.Significant">key methods and properties to assert whether
    ///   an statistical hypothesis can be supported or not</see>. Every hypothesis test is associated
    ///   with an <see cref="HypothesisTest{T}.StatisticDistribution">statistic distribution</see>
    ///   which can in turn be queried, inspected and computed as any other distribution in the 
    ///   <see cref="Accord.Statistics.Distributions"/>namespace.</para>
    ///   
    /// <para>
    ///   By default, tests are created using a 0.05 <see cref="HypothesisTest{T}.Size">significance level

    ///   inspected by checking a test's <see cref="HypothesisTest{T}.PValue">P-Value</see> property.</para>
    ///   
    /// <para>
    ///   Furthermore, several tests in this namespace also support <see cref="Accord.Statistics.Testing.Power">
    ///   power analysis</see>. The power analysis of a test can be used to suggest an optimal number of samples
    ///   which have to be obtained in order to achieve a more interpretable or useful result while doing hypothesis
    ///   testing. Power analyses implement the <see cref="IPowerAnalysis"/> interface, and analyses are available
