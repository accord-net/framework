    ///   The one-way ANOVA is a way to test for the equality of three or more means at the same
    ///   time by using variances. In its simplest form ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether
    ///   or not the means of several groups are all equal, and therefore generalizes t-test to more 
    ///   than two groups.</para>
