    ///   An Hidden Markov Model Topology specifies how many states and which
    ///   initial probabilities a Markov model should have. Two common topologies
    ///   can be discussed in terms of transition state probabilities and are
    ///   available to construction through the <see cref="Ergodic"/> and
    ///   <see cref="Forward"/> classes implementing this interface.</para>
    ///   
    ///  <para>Topology specification is important with regard to both learning and
    ///   performance: A model with too many states (and thus too many settable
    ///   parameters) will require too much training data while an model with an
    ///   insufficient number of states will prohibit the HMM from capturing subtle
    ///   statistical patterns.</para>
