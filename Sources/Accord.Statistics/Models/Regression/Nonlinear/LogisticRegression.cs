    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    ///   In statistics, logistic regression (sometimes called the logistic model or
    ///   Logit model) is used for prediction of the probability of occurrence of an
    ///   event by fitting data to a logistic curve. It is a generalized linear model
    ///   used for binomial regression.</para>
    /// <para>
    ///   Like many forms of regression analysis, it makes use of several predictor
    ///   variables that may be either numerical or categorical. For example, the
    ///   probability that a person has a heart attack within a specified time period
    ///   might be predicted from knowledge of the person's age, sex and body mass index.</para>
    /// <para>
    ///   Logistic regression is used extensively in the medical and social sciences
    ///   as well as marketing applications such as prediction of a customer's
    ///   propensity to purchase a product or cease a subscription.</para>
