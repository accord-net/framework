    /// 
    /// // In this example, we have sequences of 3-dimensional observations.

    ///     new double[][] // second sequence (note that this sequence has a different length)
    ///     {
    ///         new double[] { 1, 1, 1 }, // first observation of the second sequence
    ///         new double[] { 1, 5, 6 }, // second observation of the second sequence
    ///         new double[] { 2, 7, 1 }, // third observation of the second sequence
    ///     },
    /// 
    ///     new double[][] // third sequence 
    ///     {
    ///         new double[] { 8, 2, 1 }, // first observation of the third sequence
    ///     },

    ///         new double[] { 1, 5, 4 }, // second observation of the fourth sequence
    ///     }
    /// };
    /// 
    /// // Now, we will also have different class labels associated which each 
    /// // sequence. We will assign -1 to sequences whose observations start 
    /// // with { 1, 1, 1 } and +1 to those that do not:
    /// 
    /// int[] outputs =
    /// {
    ///     -1,-1,  // First two sequences are of class -1 (those start with {1,1,1})
    ///         1, 1,  // Last two sequences are of class +1  (don't start with {1,1,1})
    /// };
    /// 
    /// // At this point, we will have to "flat" out the input sequences from double[][][]
    /// // to a double[][] so they can be properly understood by the SVMs. The problem is 
    /// // that, normally, SVMs usually expect the data to be comprised of fixed-length 
    /// // input vectors and associated class labels. But in this case, we will be feeding
    /// // them arbitrary-length sequences of input vectors and class labels associated with
    /// // each sequence, instead of each vector.
    /// 
    /// double[][] inputs = new double[sequences.Length][];
    /// for (int i = 0; i &lt; sequences.Length; i++)
    ///     inputs[i] = Matrix.Concatenate(sequences[i]);
    /// 
    /// 
    /// // Now we have to setup the Dynamic Time Warping kernel. We will have to
    /// // inform the length of the fixed-length observations contained in each
    /// // arbitrary-length sequence:
    /// // 
    /// DynamicTimeWarping kernel = new DynamicTimeWarping(length: 3);
    /// 
    /// // Now we can create the machine. When using variable-length
    /// // kernels, we will need to pass zero as the input length:
    /// var svm = new KernelSupportVectorMachine(kernel, inputs: 0);
    /// 
    /// 
    /// // Create the Sequential Minimal Optimization learning algorithm
    /// var smo = new SequentialMinimalOptimization(svm, inputs, outputs)
    /// {
    ///     Complexity = 1.5
    /// };
    /// 
    /// // And start learning it!
    /// double error = smo.Run(); // error will be 0.0
    /// 
    /// 
    /// // At this point, we should have obtained an useful machine. Let's
    /// // see if it can understand a few examples it hasn't seem before:
    /// 
    /// double[][] a = 
    /// { 
    ///     new double[] { 1, 1, 1 },
    ///     new double[] { 7, 2, 5 },

    ///     new double[] { 4, 2, 5 },
    ///     new double[] { 1, 1, 1 },
