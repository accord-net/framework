    /// </summary>
    /// 
    /// <remarks><para>The class represents a simple proxy, which wraps the specified <see cref="NestedVideoSource"/>
    /// with the aim of asynchronous processing of received video frames. The class intercepts <see cref="NewFrame"/>
    /// event from the nested video source and fires it to clients from its own thread, which is different from the thread
    /// used by nested video source for video acquisition. This allows clients to perform processing of video frames
    /// without blocking video acquisition thread, which continue to run and acquire next video frame while current is still
    /// processed.</para>
    /// 
    /// <para>For example, let’s suppose that it takes 100 ms for the nested video source to acquire single frame, so the original
    /// frame rate is 10 frames per second. Also let’s assume that we have an image processing routine, which also takes
    /// 100 ms to process a single frame. If the acquisition and processing are done sequentially, then resulting
    /// frame rate will drop to 5 frames per second. However, if doing both in parallel, then there is a good chance to
    /// keep resulting frame rate equal (or close) to the original frame rate.</para>
    /// 
    /// <para>The class provides a bonus side effect - easer debugging of image processing routines, which are put into
    /// <see cref="NewFrame"/> event handler. In many cases video source classes fire their <see cref="IVideoSource.NewFrame"/>
    /// event from a try/catch block, which makes it very hard to spot error made in user's code - the catch block simply
    /// hides exception raised in user’s code. The <see cref="AsyncVideoSource"/> does not have any try/catch blocks around
    /// firing of <see cref="NewFrame"/> event, so always user gets exception in the case it comes from his code. At the same time
    /// nested video source is not affected by the user's exception, since it runs in different thread.</para>
