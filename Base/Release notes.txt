AForge.NET Framework 2.2.5 release notes
----------------------------------------
17.07.2013.

!!!IMPORTANT!!!

The version updates licensing of AForge.Video.FFMPEG component, which is now released
under GPL v3 license (due to dependency on GPL build of FFMPEG library). The rest of
the framework remains LGPL v3 licensed.

  - Issue 349: Implement Serializable for Matrix and Vector classes


* AForge
  - Added SquaredDistanceTo() method to Point/IntPoint/DoublePoint, which returns square of Euclidean distance.

  - Small fix to AForge.Parallel.For() - don't keep reference to for-loop's delegate, so GC could collect when needed.
  
  
* AForge.Math  
  - Fixed GrahamConvexHull so it handles correctly lists with 1 point only. Unit test is added.  
  
  - Added [Serializable] attribute to Vector3/4 and Matrix3x3/4x4 structures.
    
  
* AForge.Imaging
  - Set minimum allowed value for ColorFactor, ColorPower, SpatialFactor and SpatialPower properties of
    BilateralSmoothing to 1.
  
  - Added ProcessGapsWithImageBorders property to Horizontal/Vertical Run Length Smoothing filter, which
    allows to set if gaps between image borders and objects should be also filled or skipped.
    
  - Fixed setting DPI resolution of result image which was failing before on Mono.
  
  - Fixed OtsuThreshold bug, which was leading to wrong threshold calculation for images with highest intensity 
    maller than 255.
    
  - Fixed blobs' color standard deviation calculation for 8bpp grayscale images.

  - Fixed Sobel edge detector so it does not write beyond image buffer when doing intensity scaling step.
  
  - Added 32 bpp RGB pixel format to the list of supported formats for motion processing classes.
  
  - Minor fix for HSL to RGB conversion to make sure Alpha byte is always set to 255.

    usage to Player sample application.


* AForge.Video.DirechShow
  - Updated FilterInfo class, so Name and MonikerString are no longer read only fields but read only properties.

  - Added locking for access to video/snapshot capabilities cache and available inputs cache, so those are
    not access simultaneously from multiple threads.
    
  - Fixed setting crossbar's video input for devices which may have multiple inputs of the same type (like capture boards).
  
  - Refactoring setting of video/snapshot resolution in VideoCaptureDevice, so user can specify only values
    from the list of supported.
    
  - A workaround introduced for Windows 8 issues when ICaptureGraphBuilder2::RenderStream() fails on 12 bpp format.
    Such formats are simply ignored for now.
    
  - Added code for setting/getting camera properties.


* AForge.Video.FFMPEG
  - Fixed post build step for AForge.Video.FFMPEG, so it builds fine when path name contains spaces.
  
  - Updating version of FFMPEG library being used to 2012-01-27 - the last version before API got changed.


* AForge.Controls
  - Merged the fix which adds property allowing to keep aspect ratio in VideoSourcePlayer.
  
  
* AForge.Robotics.TeRK
  - The Qwerk class is marked as deprecated.


* AForge.Robotics.Lego
  - The RCXBrick class is marked as deprecated.




AForge.NET Framework 2.2.4.1 release notes
----------------------------------------
28.02.2012.

Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 290: Very noticeable video flicker/blinking using multiple different devices


* AForge.Video.DirechShow
  - Resetting flag which requires update of crossbar input right after the input type was set. There was a bug
    in the code which was resulting setting crossbar input type again and again causing flickering.




AForge.NET Framework 2.2.4 release notes
----------------------------------------
23.02.2012.

Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue  53: Video Capture
  - Issue  76: Can?t open video camera tv card
  - Issue 271: Complex.Phase is slightly incorrect (or at least non-standard)
  - Issue 272: Patch for /trunk/Sources/Neuro/Neurons/ActivationNeuron.cs
  - Issue 273: static Random doesn't work in multi threading without locking...
  - Issue 275: Resilient Backpropagation Learning
  - Issue 277: Test if videoCapabilities is null
  - Issue 279: Blob and BlobCounter cannot be extended as their constructors are internal. It would be good if we can extend these class.
  - Issue 280: DisplayCrossbarPropertPage method for CaptureVideoDevices.
  - Issue 281: GetPixel in UnmanagedImage class
  - Issue 282: Image is not capturing from Capture Card
  - Issue 283: Bilateral filter


* AForge.Math
  - Fixed Complex.Phase property, so it provides proper value for cases when real part is less than zero.


* AForge.Imaging
  - Blob'c constructor is made public, so could be reused by using inheritance.
  
  - Blob.CenterOfGravity property is changed to have AForge.Point type, which is float, so now calculated CoG is more accurate.
  
  - Added UnmanagedImage.GetPixel() method, which allows to get pixel out of 8/24/32 bpp image.
  
  - Added UnmanagedImage.SetPixel(int, int, byte) method, which allows setting pixel with all color component set to same value
    (for grayscale image this method is more intuitive since there is no RGB-to-grayscale conversion).
    
  - Added support of 32 bpp RGB (not ARGB) images for BlobCounter.
  
  - Added implementation of Bilateral smoothing image processing routine.
  
  - Changing BrightnessCorrection and ContrastCorrection filter to use RGB color space instead of HSL:
        1) It makes those filters faster;
        2) It removes HSL related artifacts related to Hue;
        3) It makes those filters simpler and more straight forward to users.
        If someone is unhappy by this change, he can still use HSLLinear filter to get the effect as before.
  

* AForge.Neuro
  - Replaced Neuron's static random numbers generator with its thread safe version.
  
  - Exposed Neuron.Weights, Layer.Neurons, Network.Layers properties instead of using [] accessors.
  
  - Optimized access to arrays to eliminate bound-checking.
  
  - Added implementation RProp (Resilient Back Propagation) neural network learning algorithm contributed by Cesar Souza.
  
  
* AForge.Video.DirechShow
  - VideoCaptureDevice is updated to never provide null for VideoCapabilities property. If device does not support video
    capabilities or it failed providing them, then the property will return 0 length array, but not null.
    
  - Added VideoCaptureDevice.DisplayCrossbarPropertyPage() method, which allows showing property page of a crossbar for
    the currently running video source (if it provide crossbar configuration).    

  - Added VideoCaptureDevice.AvailableCrossbarVideoInputs property, which lists available video inputs of the capture card.
    This can be used to select video input to use before running video device using your own UI.
    
  - Added VideoCaptureDevice.CrossbarVideoInput property, which allows setting video input to use by the video device.
  
  - VideoCaptureDeviceForm is updated to allow selecting video input for capture cards.
  
  
* AForge.Video.FFMPEG
  - Fixing VideoFileReader and VideoFileWriter classes so they convert file name to UTF8 string before opening file.
  
  - Fixing signing of AForge.Video.FFMPEG.dll assembly, so now it has valid signature.
  
  
* AForge.Video.Kinect
  - Updating libfreenect library with newer version which is checked out from master branch and built on February 20 2012.
  
  - Updated Kinect cameras' stopping routines, so they don't block when device was disconnected and user tries to stop cameras.
  
  - Added Kinect disconnection routine, so when Kinect device gets disconnected, cameras will stop automatically and
    specify DeviceLost as a reason.
    
  - KNOWN ISSUES: It seems like libfreenect's freenect_process_events_timeout() function still blocks when device gets lost
    causing some issue on the USB side, making it hardly possible to gracefully stop managed Kinect's status thread.
    As a workaround the AForge.NET's code sets thread type to "background", so it does not stop application from exiting.


* AForge.Controls
  - Updated Chart control so it does not check if points coordinates are in X/Y range of the control when drawing them.
    Instead of this the control sets clipping rectangle, so unwanted point/lines are not drawn.
    
  - Updated VideoSourcePlayer.GetCurrentVideoFrame() method so it returns complete copy of the current frame rather than
    the object produced by Bitmap.Clone().
    
    


AForge.NET Framework 2.2.3 release notes
----------------------------------------
12.12.2011.

Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 217: Support for Alpha component in Image.Drawing methods
  - Issue 238: Build errors and warnings under VS 2010
  - Issue 251: Cannot build from SVN
  - Issue 252: Rotate filter incorrectly calculates the size of the image after rotation
  - Issue 261: VideoFileWriter should implement IDisposable
  - Issue 262: Convolution filter generating AccessViolationException for 640x480 16bpp gray scale image
  - Issue 264: Support for the alpha channel in convolution filters
  - Issue 266: GA: Donate thread-safety to chromosomes
  - Issue 269: Support basic authentication when connecting to IP Cameras


* General
  - Updated project/solution files of the framework's sources, tool and unit tests to VS.NET 2010 (C#/C++ express 2010).

  - Updated project/solution files of all sample to use C# express edition 2010.


* AForge
  - Added ThreadSafeRandom class which is a wrapper for the System.Random class providing thread safety for random numbers
    generation methods.


* AForge.Imaging
  - Added implementation of Run Length Smoothing Algorithm (horizontal and vertical versions).

  - Improved performance of grayscale filters so those are about ~4.5 times faster doing conversion of 24/32 bpp color
    images to 8 bpp grayscale images, which is achieved by replacing floating point calculation with integer calculation.

  - Fixing Convolution filter so it processes correctly 16bpp grayscale images. Previously there was a bug causing 16 bpp
    grayscale images to be processed as 24/32 colour image.

  - Adding Width and Height properties to IntegralImage.

  - Added IntegralImage.GetHaarXWavelet() and IntegralImage.GetHaarYWavelet(), which calculate horizontal and vertical Haar wavelets.

  - Convolution filter is extended to support processing of alpha channel for 32 bpp and 64 bpp images, which is controlled
    by ProcessAlpha property (set to false by default). For filters like Blur, Mean and GaussianBlur the property is set to
    true by default, so the alpha channel gets blurred also.

  - Fixed rotation filters, so those don't shift image by one pixel, which was easy to notice when rotating by -90/90 angles.
    The bug was caused by the fact that for edge pixels source position was calculated one pixel out of image's bounds.

  - Added support for alpha blending for methods of AForge.Imaging.Drawing class.


* AForge.Math
  - Updated classes of AForge.Math namespaces to use new ThreadSafeRandom class, so random numbers generation in those
    classes becomes thread safe.


* AForge.Genetic
  - Updated classes of AForge.Genetic namespaces to use new ThreadSafeRandom class, so random numbers generation in those
    classes becomes thread safe.


* AForge.Video
  - Changing IVideoSource.BytesReceived property type from int to long, so it may fit higher values.

  - Fixing AsyncVideoSource so it does full deep cloning of bitmap provided by nested video source instead of using
    System.Drawing.Image.Clone(), which does not seem to be reliable.

  - Added ForceBasicAuthentication property for MJPEGStream and JPEGStream classes, which allows to force HTTP basic
    authentication by adding required HTTP header.


* AForge.Video.FFMPEG
  - Allow specifying of video stream bit rate when open video file using VideoFileWriter, so user could trade between
    video quality and file size.

  - Implemented IDisposable interface for VideoFileReader and VideoFileWriter classes.

  - Updating external FFMPEG library to version from November 30 2011. Updated AForge.Video.FFMPEG to build fine with
    the new FFMPEG build.


* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Fixed BytesReceived property of FileVideoSource and VideoCaptureDevice, so those provide number of provided bytes.


* Samples
  - Fixing few bugs in Blobs Explorer sample application:
    + If convex hull contain 3 point or less, then don't try finding its quadrilateral;
    + If object's edge contains only one pixel, then need to draw it individually instead of using Graphics.DrawLines() method.




AForge.NET Framework 2.2.2 release notes
----------------------------------------
16.09.2011.

Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 173: 16bpp greyscale Masked Filter
  - Issue 228: Resolution of Bitmap returned by BaseTransformationFilter.Apply is default
  - Issue 241: HuePicker control it's not shade color
  - Issue 244: Error in BlobCountingObjectsProcessing constructor
  - Issue 245: Chart control crashes sample applications for AForge.Neuro
  - Issue 246: special character (line 394) Video.VFW\win32.cs
  - Issue 249: memory leak in ToManagedImage
  - Issue 253: Problem with StDev that return NAN


* AForge.Imaging
  - Fixing AForge.Imaging.RGB class, so by default alpha channel is initialized with 255 (not transparent). Also updated HSL
    and YCbCr converters to set alpha to 255.
    
  - Added optimized version of Bayer filter, which is optimized for GRBG and BGGR patterns. Compared to generic version, the
    optimized version is about 10 times faster.
    
  - Adding try/catch block into UnmanagedImage.ToManagedImage(), so it handles possible exceptions and disposes managed image
    if it was already created.
    
  - Added ApplyMask image processing routine which applies mask to the specified image - keeps original pixels' values or
    sets them to 0 depending on corresponding value in the mask image/array.
    
  - Added MaskedFiler image processing routine, which allows to apply filter only the part of image specified by mask
    (0 values of mask tell that original pixel's value must be kept; otherwise - filtered).
    
  - Fixed flood fill classes to avoid conversion of pointer to Int32 so they should work fine on 64 bit systems.
  
  - Setting horizontal/vertical resolution of result image to the same values as source image has. The fix is applied to filters
    and image processing routines which accept Bitmap as parameter and return Bitmap as result. Obviously it can not copy DPI
    settings when image processing routine is applied to BitmapData or UnmanagedImage.


* AForge.Math
  - Added fix to PointsCloud.FindQuadrilateralCorners() so it does provide 2 same corners in the case when both 3rd and 4th
    potential corners are very close to the line connecting 1st and 2nd corner.
    
  - Fixed bug in Matrix3x3 add operator, so it adds instead of doing subtraction (silly bug).
  
  - Adding addition and subtraction operators/methods for Matrix4x4.
  
  - Exposing FocalLength property for POSIT and CoplanarPosit classes so it could be set not only using constructor.
  
  - Added Histogram.TotalCount, which represents total count of values contributed to the histogram.
  
  - Marked both Histogram and ContinuousHistogram as serializable.
  
  - Changing algorithm for standard deviation calculation from single-pass to two-pass in order to minimize numerical errors.
  

* AForge.Vision
  - Fixed one of the constructors for BlobCountingObjectsProcessing so it passes its parameter (highlighting motion detection)
    further to another constructor.
    
  - Extended motion detectors to support 8 bpp grayscale image for motion detection.
  

* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Moving VideoCaptureDeviceForm from Player sample application to AForge.Video.DirectShow namespace and beautifying it a bit.
    Now the form can be reused in other applications, which require selection of local video devices.
    
  - Updating COM interop definition for few interfaces of DirectShow (should get more stable in some cases).


* AForge.Video.Ximea
  - Added additional camera parameters/enumerations for XIMEA cameras.


* AForge.Controls
  - Updating some AForge.Controls classes to use AForge.Imaging instead of internal tools since this assembly references
    AForge.Imaging.dll anyway.
    
  - Fixing few bugs in Chart control: fixed cloning of data input data and fixed drawing of dots series type.
  
  - Added PlayingFinished event to VideoSourcePlayer, so users could track video stopping directly through the control
    without subscribing to video source events.
  

* Tools
  - Adding AForge.DebuggerVisualizers tool assembly, which allows visualizing Image, BitmapData, UnmanagedBitmap
    and Histogram objects during debugging.
    
    
* Samples
  - Fixing Motion Detector sample to perform safe update of UI (avoid cross thread access).

* General
  - Adding AForge.Video.FFMPEG namespaces, which provides classes allowing to read/write video file through
    FFmpeg library API. The code is experimental so far and is going to be extend. When extended it is supposed to
    become replacement for AForge.Video.VFW namespace someday.
    
  - Adding AForge.Video.Kinect namespaces containing classes to get access to Microsoft Xbox Kinect device.
  
  - Adding AForge.Video.Ximea namespace, which provides access to XIMEA video camera through their native
    API (m3api.dll)
    
  - Removing all use cases of lock(this) and replacing them with locking a dummy object.
  
  - Updated interoping of memcpy() and memset() to use Cdecl calling convention.
  
  - Avoiding casting of IntPtr.ToPointer() to (int), which causes issues on 64 bit systems. Instead of it is casted to (byte*).
  
  - Updated "Build All.sln" solution file, so it has "Release" and "Release Complete" configuration. "Release" is aimed
    for most users who want to build the framework. It will build all except AForge.Robotics.TeRK, which requires installation
    of ICE framework. "Release Complete" is aimed only for those who build release or do something with TeRK.


* AForge
  - Adding Point structure, which contains X/Y coordinate of float type. Adding Range structure, which is range between
    min/max of float type. Changing all AForge.NET framework classes and samples to work with Point/Range instead of
    DoublePoint/DoubleRange, which are left for some applications requiring higher precision.
    
  - {Int|Double}Range as well as {Int|Double}Point are marked [Serializable].
  
  - Added AForge.DeviceBusyException exception, which could be thrown in cases when multiple access to the same device is not allowed.
  
  - Added AForge.DeviceErrorException exception to report about possible errors in some devices.
  

* AForge.Imaging
  - Added TransformToPolar image processing routine which transforms source image to polar coordinates. Produced effect is
    similar to the one available in GIMP as "Polar Coordinates" distortion filter. The new class provides similar properties
    as configuration options in GIMP.
    
  - Added TransformFromPolar which does transformation from polar coordinates to rectangle.
  
  - Improving performance of EuclideanColorFiltering image processing routine.
  
  - Added UnmanagedImage.CollectActivePixels() method, which returns list of pixels' coordinates having none black color.
  
  - Adding UnmanagedImage.SetPixel() and UnmanagedImage.SetPixels() methods, which are nice to have is some case for visualization
    of some points. SetPixel() sets single pixel, but SetPixels() sets list of pixels.
  
  - Statistics classes now throw InvalidImagePropertiesException exception if user access invalid histogram - gray histogram
    for color image or color histograms for grayscale image.
    
  - Fixed IsGrayscale property for VerticalIntensityStatistics, HorizontalIntensityStatistics and ImageStatistics classes,
    so it returns correct value.
    
  - Added Ordered Color Dithering image processing routine as described on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering
  
  - Updated ImageStatistics, ImageStatisticsHSL and ImageStatisticsYCbCr classes so they can gather statistics over image area,
    which can be specified with a mask (8bpp image or byte[,] array).
    
  - Updating documentation of BlobCounter mentioned that InvalidImagePropertiesException exception can be thrown if provided
    image is 1 pixel wide only. It should be 2 pixels wide at least.
    
  - Updated UnmanagedImage.ToManagedImage() method to copy entire image at once if the source and destination strides are equal.
  
  - Adding UnmanagedImage.ToManagedImage(bool) which allows specifying if user wants to get managed copy of the unmanaged
    image or just a wrapper which depends on the managed image.
    
  - Added Bayer filter routine, which creates color image out of grayscale image produced by image sensor built with
    Bayer color matrix.
    
  - RotateNearestNeighbor image processing routine is extended to support 16 bpp grayscale images and 48 bpp color images.
  
  - CanvasMove is extended to support 16 bpp grayscale and 48/64 bpp color images.
    
  
* AForge.Imaging.Formats
  - Updated ImageDecoder.DecodeFromFile() to load load standard image formats (BMP, JPG, PNG, etc.) through memory stream
    instead of using standard .NET's FromFile( string fileName ) to avoid locking of the file.
  
  
* AForge.Math
  - Adding Math.Vector3 structure which provides some operations on 3D vectors.
  
  - Adding Vector4 structure, which provides some operation with 4D vectors.
  
  - Adding Matrix3x3 structure which provides some operations on 3x3 matrices.

  - Adding implementation of POSIT algorithm - 3D pose estimation algorithm described by Daniel DeMenthon and Larry Davis in
    the "Model-Based Object Pose in 25 Lines of Code".
    
  - Adding CoplanarPosit algorithm's implementation, which is an algorithm for estimating 3D pose of a model described by coplanar points.
  
  - Added AForge.Math.Statistics.Mode() method to calculate mode value of the specified histogram array.
  
  - Added equality and inequality operator for Line and LineSegment classes, as well as Equals() and GetHashCode() methods.
  
  - Fixing a bug in GrahamConvexHull, which was modifying input list of points. Some unit tests were added for GrahamConvexHull.
  
  - Fixed Mean(), StdDev() and Entropy() methods of AForge.Math.Statistics, so they don't return NaN when empty histogram (with 0 hits) is provided.
  
  - Fixing ContinuousHistogram class, so Mean and StdDev equals to zero if empty histogram (with zero hits) is provided.


* AForge.Video
  - Minor update to AsyncVideoSource class - changing manual reset event to auto reset.
  
  - Added Proxy property to both JPEGStream and MJPEGStream classes, which allow user to specify proxy server to use.
  
  - Added support for "application/octet-stream" content type into MJPEGStream class, so it is possible to get access to VLC
    streaming of web camera, for example (in the case MJPEG transcoding is used in VLC).
    
  - Setting stream's read time-out to the same value as request's time-out in MJPEGStream and JPEGStream.
  
  - Report to clients about every exception occurred in JPEGStream and MJPEGStream classes. Only ApplicationException is hidden in
    MJPEGStream class, which is thrown internally only in one case. All the rest will be sent to user for notification.
  
  - Added AFore.Video.VideoException exception, which will be used further by some video classes instead of ApplicationException.
  
  - Improving a bit reaction on thread aborting for JPEGStream and MJPEGStream classes, so they return faster when ThreadAbortException
    exception is received. 

  - Added one extra reason of video finishing, which is ReasonToFinishPlaying.VideoSourceError.
  
  - Improving frame interval processing if a pause needs to be done between video frames.


* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Updating VideoCapabilities class to provide multiple supported FPS rates for a particular resolution.
  
  - Adding try/catch blocks around getting IAMStreamConfig interface, which fails on Point Grey cameras. So with this extra
    guard these cameras should work fine now.
    
  - Added monitoring for EC_DEVICE_LOST event in VideoCaptureDevice, so it stops video capturing when device is unplugged.
    User is notified through PlayingFinished event.
    
  - Updating media event's DirectShow wrapper, so events are correctly detected on 64-bit systems (eventû like device lost
    and end of video file).
    
  - VideoCaptureDevice is extended to support still image snapshots, which can be made using camera's shutter button or by
    simulating the trigger. The snapshots are provided through the new SnapshotFrame event. Capabilities of snapshots can be checked
    using SnapshotCapabilities property and desired snapshot size can be set using DesiredSnapshotSize property.
    
  - When desired video size is set, perform search of complete media type structure and set it as it is configured when enumerating
    capabilities (fixes thes issue with Microsoft's LifeCam).
    
  - Added try/catch block around retrieving IAMVideoControl interface, since it seems like some USB camera drivers don't support this interface.
  
  - Updated signature of memcpy() in AForge.Video.DirectShow so it uses byte* instead of int. Also ToPointer() is used
    with IntPtr instead of ToInt32(). Should get better on x64 systems now.
    
    
* AForge.Video.VFW
  - Updating exception types thrown by AVIReader and AVIWriter, so they are different for different type of exceptions.
    

* AForge.Robotics.Lego
  - Added constructor for NXTBrick.MotorState structure, so it is "easer" to initialize it from user's code.
  
  - Turned NXT structures into classes and provided properties for them (many of them are read-only since those are supposed to
    be set by framework, not by user).
  
  - NXTBrick.SendCommand() is made public, so users may send their own custom messages.
  
  - Added NXTBrick.MessageRead and NXTBrick.MessageSent events, so a communication listener could be implemented.
  
  - NXTBrick class is extended with 3 extra method: ReadHiTechnicColorSensor(), ReadHiTechnicCompassSensor() and
    ReadHiTechnicAccelerationTiltSensor(), which read HiTechnic's color, compass and acceleration sensors.
  
  - NXTBrick.ResetMotorPosition() method is extended with extra parameter, which allows to reset either relative or absolute
    motor's position.
    
  - Updated documentation of NXTBrick.SensorType enumeration.
  
  - Improved documentation for NXTBrick.SensorMode enumeration.
  
  - Some improvements for communication with Lego NXT brick, see ticket #219
  
  - Added overloads for PlayTone(), SetMotorState(), ResetMotorPosition(), SetSensorMode(), ClearSensor() and LsWrite() methods
    of NXTBrick class, which can send commands without waiting for reply - faster versions.
    
  
* AForge.Controls
  - VideoSourcePlayer is extended to support cameras providing 16 bpp grayscale or 48/64 bpp color image.

  - Merged HuePicker control from IPLab project into the AForge.NET framework. Some polishing of the class and its documentation
    was done.
    
  - Making sure VideoSourcePlayer control gets resized if image from video source changes its size.
  
  - Fixing VideoSourcePlayer so it does not cause dead lock if user does access to UI using Invoke() in NewFrame event handler
    (moving NewFrame event firing out of lock block).
	
  - Making sure that Chart control displays only data which are in the configure x/Y range. Also updating Y range if required
    when new X range is set.

  
* Tools
  - Added check for IPPrototyper's window position stored in configuration file. If window outside of the screen, then use its
    default location. Window may get outside if the application was used on a system with multiple screens last time and the it
    is started again when one of the screens got disconnected.
    
  - Created separate AForge.Imaging.IPPrototyper assembly, which holds interfaces for image processing prototyping and default
    implementation of IImageProcessingLog interface. Updated IPPrototyper tool and sample application to accommodate these changes.
    

* Samples
  - Adding Snapshot Maker sample application, which demonstrates recently added feature for making snapshots using DirectShow
    device (USB camera).
  
  - Adding new sample applications, which demonstrate usage of Posit and CoplanarPosit algorithms recently added to
    AForge.Math.Geometry namespace.
    
  - Adding Kinect Capture sample application which demonstrates access to MS Xbox Kinect device.
  
  - Updated NXT sample application to demonstrates MessageSent and MessageRead events provided by NXT brick.
  
  - Adding sample application demonstrating access to XIMEA camera.
  
  - Improving FPS counter for "Player" and "Two Camera Test sample" applications.

  - Issue 178: HueModifier does not work with 32bpp images
  - Issue 181: Bicubic resize kernel is badly implemented
  - Issue 182: Make PointsCloud accept a wider variety of arguments
    

* AForge
  - Fixing bug in IntRange.IsOverlapping() and DoubleRange.IsOverlapping(), when these methods report
    "false" (no overlapping) in the case if specified range completely covers and wider than the range
    of the instance which method is invoked.
    
  - Added equality and inequality operators for IntPoint and DoublePoint.
  

*AForge.Math
  - Added a check for greater than 0 in IsPowerOf2() function. It will return false for everything which is <= 0.
  
  - Introducing Line class in AForge.Math.Geometry, which is supposed to keep lines' related methods.
  
  - Committing contributed code, which is about distance and similarity metrics. New classes are placed into
    AForge.Math.Metrics namespace.

  - Fixing PointsCloud.FindQuadrilateralCorners() so it does not return 4 corners in some cases, where 2 of them are the same.

  - Fixes to PointsCloud.FindQuadrilateralCorners():
    1) Fixing the issue of detecting flat rectangles with high aspect ratio between adjacent sides;
    2) Adding PointsCloud.QuadrilateralRelativeDistortionLimit static property, so user could tweak distortion limit
       if he understands what he does.
       
  - Changed methods of PointsCloud class to accept IEnumerable<IntPoint> instead of List<IntPoint>. Only Shift()
    method is changed to accept IList<IntPoint>.

    
* AForge.Imaging
  - Adding support for custom blobs' filtering routines, which implement IBlobsFilter interface.
  
  - Improved automatic calculation of new image's size which is the result of quadrilateral transformation.
  
  - Image.FormatImage() is marked as deprecated and Image.Clone() should be used instead with specifying desired pixel format.
  
  - Fixing Convolution image processing filter to copy alpha channel values as they are for 32 bpp images.
  
  - Added support of 32-bit images to CornersMarker and MoravecCornersDetector.
  
  - Changing implementation of PointedColorFloodFill to use queue instead of stack, so the image processing routine
    will not generate stack overflow any more. It is speed is a bit reduced as a result of this, but it may get
    noticeable only when processing thousands of images (depends on image size of course).

  - Adding FillHoles image processing routine, which allows to fill black holes in white objects in binary images.
  
  - Added median cut color quantization algorithms. Also added helper ColorImageQuantizer class, which simplifies calculation
    of reduced color table for images or their re-coloring.
    
  - Adding color dithering image processing routines, which are placed into AForge.Imaging.ColorReduction namespace.
  
  - Small improvement in Integral Image calculation for minor calculation speed-up.
  
  - Adding local thresholding routine described by Derek Bradley and Gerhard Roth in the "Adaptive Thresholding Using
    the Integral Image" paper (see BradleyLocalThresholding class).
    
  - Adding ThresholdedDifference and ThresholdedEuclideanDifference, which calculate threshold difference of two images
    (one class uses Manhattan distance to calculate difference between pixel values, but another class uses Euclidean distance).
    
  - Changing bicubic kernel for resize and rotation image processing routines to the one described on Wikipedia
    (coefficient "a" is set to -0.5).
    
  - !! Backward compatibility breaking change !! Changing type of Blob.Image from Bitmap to UnmanagedImage, since in
    most cases extracting of blob's image is required for its further processing, but not just for displaying
    (.NET's Bitmap type does not make any sense doing image processing).
    
  - Fixed HueModifier image processing routine to process correctly 32 bpp images (using correct pixel size value).
  

* AForge.Video
  - Updating MJPEGStream video source class to remove double quotes from start/end of boundary, which can
    be added by some IP cameras.
    
  - Adding AsyncVideoSource, which is a proxy video source for asynchronous processing of another nested video source.
  
  - Improving boundary parsing in MJPEGStream video source class, so it accepts more cameras which tend to have their
    own specifics in MJPEG stream.    
    
    
* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Fixed bug in disposing of DirectShow AMMediaType structure. The bug was introduced in 2.1.4 version.


* AForge.Genetic
  - Modified PermutationChromosome.CreateChildUsingCrossover() to use arrays for fast lookup of genes'
    indexes in parents' chromosomes.
    

* AForge.Controls
  - Added check for cross-thread access to most methods/properties (those which are not allowed to be accessed
    from another thread) of VideoSourcePlayer class. Lock is still kept in some methods/properties, which access
    video frame (this must be protected anyway).    

  
* IPPrototyper
  - Adding AutoSize size mode for picture box, which is nice to have when processing big images, which may need scrolling.

  - Recent folders list size is increased to 7.




AForge.NET Framework 2.1.4 release notes
----------------------------------------
01.09.2010.


Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 139: Possible Type Improvement in CannyEdgeDetector.cs
  - Issue 142: Behaviour mismatch between SobelEdgeDetector.Apply and SobelEdgeDetector.ApplyInPlace
  - Issue 143: Off-by-one error in PointsCloud.GetCenterOfGravity
  - Issue 147: Perform SimpleQuadrilateralTransformation on entire image.
  - Issue 149: Round DoublePoint to IntPoint, rather than truncating.


* General
  - Adding some unit test based on Gallio Automation Platform. The unit tests mostly cover new
    recently added features for now. See "Unit Tests\Read Me.txt" for additional information.

  - Adding initial version of IPPrototyper application (Image Processing Prototyper) - a tool which is
    aimed to help prototyping/testing of image processing and computer vision routines.
    

* AForge
  - Added IntPoint.EuclideanNorm() and DoublePoint.EuclideanNorm() methods, which calculate point's
    distance to (0, 0) point.
    
  - Added DoublePoint.Round() method to round point to IntPoint using Math.Round().


* AForge.Math
  - Switching GeometryTools class to be public, which contains few tool methods to calculate angle
    between two vectors and angle between two lines.
    
  - Fixing bug of GetCenterOfGravity(), where first point was not taken into account.
    

* AForge.Imaging
  - Fixing an old somehow survived typo - changing "FormatTransalations" to "FormatTranslations".
    This change may affect those users, who use the property.
    
  - Fixing a bug in line drawing (Drawing.Line()) - avoiding division by zero.
  
  - Adding UnmanagedImage.Collect8bppPixelValues() and UnmanagedImage.Collect16bppPixelValues() methods
    to collect pixels' values from the list of specified coordinates.

  - Adding SimpleQuadrilateralTransformation as replacement of QuadrilateralTransformationBilinear and
    QuadrilateralTransformationNearestNeighbor filters. The new filter does transformation as with
    interpolation, as without.

  - QuadrilateralTransformationBilinear and QuadrilateralTransformationNearestNeighbor are marked as deprecated
    and generate warning if used. But still work.
    
  - BaseQuadrilateralTransformationFilter is removed as no longer required.
  
  - Adding QuadrilateralTransformation - an implementation of quadrilateral transformation based on homogeneous
    transformation.
    
  - Adding BackwardQuadrilateralTransformation - an image processing routine to transform given source
    image into specified quadrilateral area of destination image.

  - Putting black rectangle around processing area, so result of edge detectors look the same in the case
    if Apply() or ApplyInPlace() methods are called (ApplyInPlace() was leaving some garbage from original image).
    
  - Extending DocumentSkewChecker and HoughLineTransformation to allow processing of specified rectangle only,
    so lines could be searched only in the area of interest.
    
  - DocumentSkewChecker: Replacing MinBeta and MaxBeta properties with single MaxSkewToDetect property,
    which covers both. Also removing cycled checking of lines' angles, since it is not required due to
    limited range of detection.
    

* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Fixing disposing of AMMediaType.
  
  - Improving FileVideoSource, so it can play video files which have audio stream as their first stream
    (which becomes first output pin of IBaseFilter). First output pin was always taken before and used for
    connection with input pin of sample grabber. However it was failing in those cases, when first output pin
    had audio type. Now the code is changed to iterate through source's output pins searching for one, which
    can be connected with sample grabber.
    
  - Changing DirectShow related classes to use IMediaControl::Stop() method instead of IMediaControl::StopWhenReady()
    which allows data queuing, which does not seem to be required.
    
    
* AForge.Controls
  - Adding addition "request to stop" volatile boolean variable in VideoSourcePlayer to avoid trying
    handle NewFrame event when WaitForStop() is already invoked, so rare deadlock is avoided.


* Samples
  - Adding "IPPrototyper Sample" application - demonstrates usage of IPPrototype tool.




AForge.NET Framework 2.1.3 release notes
----------------------------------------
01.07.2010.


Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 132: Adjustable Threshold for blob counter  
  - Issue 135: Convert from Format16bppGrayScale to Format8bppIndexed is missing 
  - Issue 136: Enhancement to disable reference clock on DirectShow graphs
  - Issue 137: Improvement request for svs  
  - Issue 138: Enable amendment of Population size on the fly


* AForge.Math
  - Adding interface for shape optimizers its 3 implementations:
    1) FlatAnglesOptimizer - shape optimizer, which removes obtuse angles (close
       to flat) from a shape;
    2) LineStraighteningOptimizer - shape optimizer, which removes points within
       close range to shapes' body;
    3) ClosePointsMergingOptimizer - shape optimizer, which merges points within
       close distance to each other.

  - Added SimpleShapeChecker class for checking simple geometrical shapes.

  - Bug fix in GrahamConvexHull - don't process points with same coordinates as the first point.

  - Few updates to PointsCloud.FindQuadrilateralCorners():
    1) Bug fix - wrong points were used to compare distances between points;
    2) Using relative distortion limit instead of hard-coded constants for checking if certain
       points are far away enough;
    3) Searching first point as the furthest from shape's centre, instead of from (0, 0) point
       of coordinates system.


* AForge.Imaging
  - Fixing SusanCornersDetector - don't dispose internal grey image in the case if
    greyscale image was given as input.

  - Increasing size limits for convolution's kernel size and structuring element of
    morphological operators. The limit is set to 99. The benefit of such big kernels
    is not clear, but if users want it and ready to wait until such lengthy image processing
    is done, then why not to give it to them.

  - Added background threshold property to blob counters, so thresholding step could be
    skipped in many cases.

  - Adding LevelsLinear16bpp image processing filter, which is similar to LevelsLinear,
    but designed for images with 16 bpp planes - 16 bpp grayscale or 48/64 bpp images.

  - Added two methods into AForge.Imaging.Image class: Convert16bppTo8bpp() and Convert8bppTo16bpp()
    which perform conversion of images with 16 bpp color planes to images with 8 bpp color planes
    and vice versa.

  - Few minor improvements to CannyEdgeDetector: changed from double to int type for those
    variables, which are really integer; removed incrementing index variable, which is not used
    inside of a loop; clarified documentation about hysteresis.


* AForge.Video
  - Putting check of IsRunning property into Start() method of all video sources, so
    it checks if video source is really running or not. Checking thread variable for null
    was not a good check if user calls SignalToStop() without further WaitForStop().


* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Merging the code contributed by Jeremy Noring, which allows to disable reference clock
    of a DirectShow graph allowing to process video files as fast as possible.


* AForge.Genetic
  - Fixing Population.FindBestChromosome() method to make sure that a chromosome will be selected
    even if all chromosome have fitness value equal to 0.

  - Added Population.Resize() method which allows to resize genetic population during its lifetime.


* AForge.Robotics.Surveyor
  - Added SVS.ServosBank.Bank0, so users could control servos connected to TMR2-1 and TMR3-1 of
    SVS board (in the case of some custom set-up).


* Samples
  - Added sample application to demonstrate usage of SimpleShapeChecker class.

* AForge
  - Adding addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operators between IntPoint/DoublePoint and scalar values.
  
  - Added operator for explicit casting of DoublePoint to IntPoint.
  
  - Added operator for implicit casting of IntPoint to DoublePoint, so integer points could be used in operations with
    double precision points.
    

* AForge.Imaging
  - Fixed a rounding bug in Hough Line Transformation, causing unnecessary doubling of the Hough transformation
    values near zero radius.

  - HoughCircleTransformation is update to return zero length array of circles instead of null in the case if no
    circles detected.
    
  - Added BlobCounterBase.GetBlobsEdgePoints() method, which return unsorted list of blob's edge points. Produces
    similar result as GetBlobsLeftAndRightEdges() combined with GetBlobsTopAndBottomEdges(), but each point occurs
    only once in the list. The method is useful for shape analyzers, convex hull routines, etc.    
    
  - Adding WaterWave filter - image processing filter implementing simple water wave effect.
  
  - Added ImageWarp image processing filter, which sets pixels in destination image to values from source image taken
    with specified offset.

  - Added two more properties into Blob class, which are calculated by BlobCounterBase automatically - mean and standard
    deviation of blob's color.
    

* AForge.Math
   - Add PointsCloud.GetBoundingRectangle() method to search for minimum/maximum X/Y coordinates in the specified
     list of points.
     
   - Update constructor of GaussianGenerator to pass specified seed to StandardGenerator, which was previously ignored.

   - Fixed bug in ContinuousHistogram class, which was causing wrong calculation of mean and std.dev. values after
     calling Update() method.

   - Optimizing calculation of standard deviation by doing single pass through histogram array instead of two as it was before.


* AForge.Fuzzy
   - "NOT" operator is implemented for fuzzy rules.
   

* AForge.Controls
  - Removing generation of exception in the case if user tries to change video source for VideoSourcePlayer control
    without stopping currently played. User may want to control video starting and stopping on his own, so control
    should not add any restrictions regarding this.
    
  - Adding ManipulatorColor to AForge.Controls namespace, so it is no longer required to duplicate sources in every
    robotics sample or other projects.
    
  - Adding SliderControl control, which allows dragging manipulator in [-1, 1] range.
    
  - Adding AForge.Controls.Joystick class, which represents a simple wrapper around Win32 joystick API.
  
    
* AForge.Video
  - Fixing MJPEGStream to skip clients' notification, if the video source was requested to stop.

  - Adding support for AirLink IP cameras, which are not very accurate with HTTP standard (fix contributed by Ivan Farkas).


* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Fixing some memory leaks (COM objects) in AForge.Video.DirectShow.
  
  - Changing the way of displaying camera's property:
     1) If VideoCaptureDevice is already running, then request for property page displaying is passed to worker thread;
     2) Otherwise local temporary source object is created to display property page.

  - Using IGraphBuilder.AddSourceFilter( fileName, ... ) method for adding source filter for playing video files
    instead of creating AsyncReader manually and adding it to the graph. The fix allows playing such video files
    like WMV, which did not play before with AForge.Video.DirectShow.FileVideoSource.
  
  
* AForge.Robotics.Surveyor
  - Fixing bug in SVS.Disconnect() method - wrong object was accessed for aborting right camera.
  
  - Adding check to make sure stopEvent is not null, which may happen when tread is aborted (solves rare
    NullReferenceException, which may happen on disconnecting from SRV-1).

* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Replacing interop usage of olepro32.dll to oleaut32.dll for OleCreatePropertyFrame() API call, so accessing
    this API call works correctly on Windows 64-bit version.

  - Issue 110: GetMostIntensiveLines(count) returns null
  - Issue 112: Provide binaries as a .zip file
  
  
* AForge
  - Added zero initialization of allocated unmanaged images, since Marshal.AllocHGlobal() does not
    care about it.
    
  - Moving exceptions, which are related to connections to device, from AForge.Robotics.TeRK to AForge namespace,
    so they could be reused in other namespaces as well.

    copying managed image to it.

  - Added documentation to UnmanagedImage to clarify its purpose.
  
  - Bug fix in SimplePosterization image processing filter.
  
  - Added black rectangle drawing in CannyEdgeDetector to remove unprocessed pixels. This is required in
    the case if the filter is applied in-place.
    
  - Created set of predefined common grayscaling algorithms, which are available as read only instances of
    Grayscale class. These predefined instances are available in Grayscale.CommonAlgorithms class. Old
    classes like GrayscaleBT709, GrayscaleRMY, GrayscaleY are marked as obsolete.
    
  - Both GetMostIntensiveLines() and GetLinesByRelativeIntensity() methods in HoughLineTransformation class
    were updated to return array of zero length instead of null in the case when there are no lines to return.
    
  - Updated documentation to HoughLineTransformation and HoughLine clarifying different aspects of Hough Line
    transformation. Provided sample code to highlight detected lines. Provided sample image with annotation

  - Added ability to change activation function of neuron/layer/network.
  

* AForge.Robotics.Lego
  - Added GetUltrasonicSensorsValue() method for NXT brick to read values of ultrasonic distance sensor.
  

* AForge.Robotics.TeRK
  - Added 2500 ms connection timeout to Qwerk classes. QwerkStart sample update to handle lost connection.
  

* AForge.Video
  - Added PlayingFinished event to IVideoSource interface. The event is fired in the case video
    stops by reaching end of video stream or by canceling by user.
  
  
* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Added VideoCapabilities property to VideoCaptureDevice class, which can be used to resolve supported
    frame sizes and maximum frame rates.


* AForge.Vision
  - MillisecondsPerBackgroundUpdate property is introduced in SimpleBackgroundModelingDetector, which
    allows to control background update on the base of time intervals, but not on the base of frames'
    counter. This allows to control background update in the way, which is not affected by variable frame
    rates. Also the method better handles those case, when video source has very low frame rate (where
    FramesPerBackgroundUpdate would not perform very well causing very long time to update background).
    
    
* Samples
  - Fixing FilterDemo application - added grayscaling before edge detectors (all edge detectors
    require grayscaling).

  - Added ImageViewer sample application, which demostrates usage of new
    AForge.Imaging.Formats namespace.
     
  - Added QwertStart sample application, which demonstrates basics of using
    new AForge.Robotics.TeRK namespace and performs basic manipulations
    of Qwerk.
     
  - Added Player sample, which demonstrates usage of AForge.Video.* namespaces
    for playing different video source.
     
  - Added Two Cameras Test sample application, which demonstrates how to open
    two web cameras simultaneously. Also may serve as useful utility of testing
    two cameras from the same manufacturer (some cameras do not support dual
    setup, so it is nice to have something to that quickly).


* and just many smaller updates in this version ...

    two images.

  - IBlockMatching interface is introduced for blcok matching algorithms. As a first class, which
    implements this interface, an ExhaustiveBlockMatching class is provided, which does exhaustive
    search of blocks from source image in search image within specified radius.

  - Drawing class is extended to draw lines.

    luminance component (all non-black pixels will form non-zero luminance).


* AForge.Vision
  - HighPrecisionBackgroundModeling class is fixed to handle correctly the case when noise suppression is
    off and motion edges highlighting is on.

  - Added more checks to handle the case when user passes motion zones array with 0 elements.

    since it may be null and lead to exception.


* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Added functionality to display property page of video capture device, which allows changing its
    settings provided by driver (contrast, brightness, frame size, etc).

  - VideoCaptureDevice class is extended with DesiredFrameRate and DesiredFrameSize properties, which
    allow to configure frame rate and size. Class is reworked to create capture graph using ICaptureGraphBuilder2

------------------------------
11.02.2008.


Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 32: Impossible to play some video files with Video.DirectShow.
  - Issue 33: Extending of Complex Image.
  - Issue 36: Stevenson-Arce dithering is useless.
  - Issue 39: Extracting blobs from color image.

* General
  - AForge.NET framework's license is updated and clarified. The license concentrates not on commercial
    vs. not-commercial software but on open vs. closed software. The framework is provided under dual
    license: GPL v2 for free and LGPL for a fee. Please, refer to License.txt document for more
    details.

  - AForge.Robotics.Lego library introduced, which provides classes to manipulate Lego
    NXT Mindstorm device. Test application is added to samples collection.

  - Documentation projects were updated for new versions of Sandcastle and Sandcastle Help File Builder.


* AForge.Imaging
  - Otsu thresholding is added (N. Otsu, "A threshold selection method from gray-level histograms",
    IEEE Trans. Systems, Man and Cybernetics 9(1), pp. 6266, 19790).

  - Added initial implementation of Integral Image (P. Viola and M. J. Jones, "Robust real-time face detection",
    Int. Journal of Computer Vision 57(2), pp. 137154, 2004).
    TODO: Some more methods are going to be added, which calculate features described by Viola and Jones.

  - Moravec corners detector is added (http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dparks/CornerDetector/mainMoravec.htm).

  - Horizontal and Vertical Intensity Statistics classes are added to the AForge.Imaging namespace. These classes
    provide information about horizontal and vertical distribution of pixel intensities.

  - Corners Marker filter added, which highlights corder of objects on the specified image using provided
    corners detection algorithm.

  - ComplexImage is extended with public property, which gives access to complex image's data. It gives
    possibility to implement additional classes to do filtering on ComplexImage.

  - IComplexFilter interface provided for filters, which work on complex Fourier transformed images.
    Frequency filter is moved out of ComplexImage to separate class.

  - Documentation has improved for binarization filters.

  - Stevenson-Arce dithering class is marked as obsolete since it is supposed to work with hexagonal pixel
    lattices. The filter is left for educational purpose.

  - BlobCounterBase class allows to extract blobs not only from binary/grayscale images, but from color
    images as well. Useful in the case if color image was grayscaled, thresholded, processed by blob counter
    and then it is required to extract blob from original image.

  - Iterative Threshold's performance improved by using image histogram instead of scanning entire image on
    each iteration.

  - FillRectangle() method added to Drawing class for filling rectangles on locked image.


* AForge.Math
  - Added Update() method to histogram classes, so it is possible to recalculate statistical values after
    direct changes in Values array of histogram.

  
* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Fixed the issue that it was not possible to play some videos. The issue was cause by fixing issue 22
    (1.5.1 version). Removing call of graph's Render() method solves the issue with freezing video after screen
    saver, but introduces another issue when playing some video files. The Render() method is adding not only
    renderer filter, but some other filters, which may be required. To configure this, a new property was
    introduced - PreventFreezing, which allows to select what is required - freezing preventing removing Render()
    call or not preventing leaving it.


* AForge.Controls
  - Histogram control is added to AForge.Controls namespace, which is originally taken from IPLab application,
    but extended with vertical histograms support.

    with support of motion zones - zones, where motion detection should be done.

  - Counting motion detector was introduced, which allows to count moving objects and retrieve position and
    dimension of each object.


* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - VideoCaptureDevice and FileVideoSource classes were updated - Render() method call of IGraphBuilder interface
    was removed. The method was completing graph with additional filters required for rendering, which were
    causing video stopping in the case of screen saver or workstation locking. Since we use Sample Grabber and
    we do our own rendering, the call was not actually required.


* Samples
  - Motion Detector sample was updated to demonstrate counting motion detector and motion zones configuration.
