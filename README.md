The Accord.NET project provides machine learning, statistics, artificial intelligence, computer vision and image processing methods to .NET. It can be used on Microsoft Windows, Xamarin, Unity3D, Windows Store applications, Linux or mobile.

After merging with the AForge.NET project, the framework now offers a unified API for learning/training machine learning models that is both easy to use *and* extensible. It is based on the following pattern:

- Choose a [learning algorithm](http://accord-framework.net/docs/html/N_Accord_MachineLearning.htm) that provides a Learn(x, y) or Learn(x) method;
- [Use the Learn(x, y)](http://accord-framework.net/docs/html/M_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines_Learning_SequentialMinimalOptimization_Learn.htm) to create a [machine learning model](http://accord-framework.net/docs/html/T_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines_SupportVectorMachine.htm) learned from the data; 
- Use the model's [Transform](http://accord-framework.net/docs/html/M_Accord_MachineLearning_ClassifierBase_2_Transform.htm), [Decide](http://accord-framework.net/docs/html/M_Accord_MachineLearning_ClassifierBase_2_Decide_1.htm), [Scores](http://accord-framework.net/docs/html/M_Accord_MachineLearning_BinaryScoreClassifierBase_1_Scores_3.htm), [Probabilities](http://accord-framework.net/docs/html/M_Accord_MachineLearning_BinaryLikelihoodClassifierBase_1_Probabilities.htm) or [LogLikelihoods](http://accord-framework.net/docs/html/M_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines_SupportVectorMachine_2_LogLikelihood.htm) methods.

# Installing

To install the framework in your application, please use NuGet. If you are on Visual Studio, right-click on the "References" item in your solution folder, and select "Manage NuGet Packages." Search for Accord.MachineLearning ([or equivalently, Accord.Math, Accord.Statistics or Accord.Imaging depending on your initial goal](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=accord.net)) and select "Install."

If you would like to install the framework on [Unity3D applications](https://unity3d.com), download the "libsonly" compressed archive from the [framework releases page](https://github.com/accord-net/framework/releases). Navigate to the Releases/Mono folder, and copy the .dll files to the Plugins folder in your Unity project. Finally, find and add the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.dll assembly that should be available from your system to the Plugin folders as well.

## Sample applications

The framework comes with a wide range of sample applications to help get you started quickly. If you downloaded the framework sources or cloned the repository, open the *Samples.sln* solution file in the Samples folder.


# Building

#### With Visual Studio 2015

Please download and install the following dependencies:

- [T4 Toolbox for Visual Studio 2015](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/34b6d489-afbc-4d7b-82c3-dded2b726dbc)
- [Sandcastle Help File Builder (with VS2015 extension)](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB/releases)
- [NUnit 3 Test Adapter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NUnitDevelopers.NUnit3TestAdapter)

Then navigate to the Sources directory, and open the *Accord.NET.sln* solution file. Note: the solution includes F# unit test projects that can be disabled/unloaded from the solution in case you do not have support for F# tools in your version of Visual Studio.


#### With Visual Studio 2017

Please download and install the following dependencies:

- [T4 Toolbox for Visual Studio 2017](https://github.com/hagronnestad/T4Toolbox/releases/tag/vs2017-b1)
- [Sandcastle Help File Builder (with VS2017 extension)](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB/releases)
- [NUnit 3 Test Adapter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NUnitDevelopers.NUnit3TestAdapter)
- [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145&751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6) (both x64 and x86)

Then navigate to the Sources directory, and open the *Accord.NET.sln* solution file. Note: the solution includes F# unit test projects that can be disabled/unloaded from the solution in case you do not have support for F# tools in your version of Visual Studio.
