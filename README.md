 The Accord.NET Framework 
 http://accord-framework.net


  The Accord.NET Framework provides machine learning, mathematics, statistics,
  computer vision, computer audition, and several scientific computing related
  methods and techniques to .NET. The project extends the popular AForge.NET 
  Framework providing a more complete scientific computing environment.
 
  The GitHub repository at https://github.com/accord-net/framework is the official 
  home of the project after release 2.10 was finished. As such, new releases will 
  only be made available on this repository.
