[assembly: AssemblyDescription(
@"This sample application shows how to use the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to fit linear regression models. The algorithm can work with any model or function, producing a robust version of the model which is less sensitive to outliers.

Although this sample application relates specifically to linear regression estimation, RANSAC also makes an important role in the Image Stitching (Panorama) sample applications in the Imaging sample application folder.")]
