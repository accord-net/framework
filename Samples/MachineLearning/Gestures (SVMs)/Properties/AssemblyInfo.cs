[assembly: AssemblyDescription(
@"This sample application shows how to use variable-length Support Vector Machines for sequence classification using the Dynamic Time Warping kernel function. Using this function, SVMs can accept variable-length input vectors and handle them as sequence of observations, just like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can do.

You can also find the HMM version of this application in the Statistics sample application folder.")]
