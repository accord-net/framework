[assembly: AssemblyDescription(
@"This sample application demonstrates how to create and use Decision Trees to learn and classify instances into multi-class classification problems. Decision trees are simple predictive models which map input attributes to a target value using simple conditional rules. Trees are commonly used in problems whose solutions must be readily understandable or explainable by humans, such as in computer-aided diagnostics and credit analysis. 

This sample application allows the user to inspect the generated tree using a simplified TreeView-like control.")]
