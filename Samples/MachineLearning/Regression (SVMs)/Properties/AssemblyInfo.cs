[assembly: AssemblyDescription(
@"This sample application shows how to use Kernel Support Vector Machines (k-SVMs) to solve regression problems. The sample application comes with default sample data with can be loaded in the File->Open menu.

After a sample data has been loaded, one can configure the settings and create a learning machine in the second tab. The framework offers an extensive list of kernel functions to choose from (although only a few are available in the sample application, for demonstration purposes).

For classification problems, please take a look at the Classification (SVM) sample application.")]
