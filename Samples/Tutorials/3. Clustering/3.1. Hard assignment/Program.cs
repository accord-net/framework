            // In the previous chapters, we have seen how the many models in the Accord.NET Framework 
            // could be used used to solve classification and regression problems. A common aspect in
            // these kinds of problems is that our target output data is always available: be it a set
            // of class labels in the case of classification, or a set of real values in the case of
            // regression. However, there is a different family of problems in which neither of those
            // are available: clustering.

            // In a clustering problem, we would like to extract some useful information about a data
            // set without having exact knowledge about it. A typical application for clustering is in
            // user profiling: let's say we would like to discover groups of users who behave in similar
            // ways when interacting with a system. If we had a database with details on user interaction,
            // we could use a clustering algorithm to "cluster" (group) together people that behave in
            // the same way.
