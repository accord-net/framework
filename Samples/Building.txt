Accord.NET samples building instructions
==========================================

For now, in order to build the Accord.NET sample applications you
should preferably open the main solution file (Accord.NET.sln)
located in the Sources directory and run the selected application
from there. This allows for easier debugging of the Framework.

If you wish to build samples separately, please correct the references
in their respective solutions.
