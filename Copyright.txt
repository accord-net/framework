Overall framework architecture and style was greatly inspired by AForge.NET. In May 2015, this project
has been merged with the AForge.NET framework since public support for AForge.NET has ended. The original
AForge.NET Framework is a copyrighted work by Andrew Kirillov, altough developed and shared under the same
LGPL license.



This library also contains routines adapted from Lutz Roeder's Mapack for .NET, LAPACK and Jama
routines. Jama has been released under the public domain. LAPACK has been released under a compatible
3-clause BSD license, listed below. Original ArrayDataView code is copyright (c) 2004 Mihail Stefanov,
licensed under the LGPL with permission of the original author. Original SortableBindingList source
code is copyright (c) 2008 Tim Van Wassenhove, licensed under the LGPL with permission of the original
author. Statistics module contains code for computing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution based on
original code by Richard Simard, redistributed under the LGPL with permission of the original author.
Imaging module contains code for Gabor filter based on the original code by Max Bügler, redistributed
under the LGPL with permission of the original author. 

The Augmented Lagrangian Solver implementation is based on the NLopt Numerical Optimization Library, 
copyright (c) 2008 Steven G. Johnson, distributed under the MIT license. Some image filters have been
contributed by Diego Catalano, distributed under the LGPL license and included with permission of the
original author. Mathematics module includes the Kinematic joint models by Rémy Dispagne, licensed
under the LGPL with permission of the original author. The Haar Object detector contains contributions
from Darko Jurić, added with permission of the original author.

The Accord.Vision module includes definitions for Haar Cascades created by Modesto Castrillon-Santana,
distributed under the LGPL with permission of the original author. The SURF interest points detector
implementation is based on code by Christopher Evans, licensed under the LGPL with permission of the
original author. The FAST corners detector has been created using a code generation tool created by
Edward Rosten, distributed under a compatible 3-clause BSD license, listed below. The Camshift tracker
implementation is based on the FaceIt ActionScript Camshift tracker, copyright (c) 2009 Benjamin Jung,
distributed under the MIT license, listed below. The Project Marilena is copyright (c) 2008 Masakazu
