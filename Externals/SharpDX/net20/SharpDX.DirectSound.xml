Although the older<strong>DirectSoundCaptureCreate</strong>function can also be used to obtain theIDirectSoundCapture8interface, the object created by that function cannot be used to create capture buffers that support theIDirectSoundCaptureBuffer8interface.

            <table><tr><th>Windows </th></tr><tr><td><p>Important Note for Windows Vista</p> <p>Existing applications that access Windows XP Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) features via the DirectSound API will no longer obtain AEC when running on Windows Vista. These applications will still run, but their calls to AEC-specific DirectSound API calls will have no effect on the captured audio.</p><p>To learn how to obtain AEC in Windows Vista, See the Windows Vista AEC topics in the Windows SDK.</p></td></tr></table> <p>The three least significant bits in *pdwStatus describe the convergence history; that is, the success of the effect in canceling the echo. The convergence history can be used by the application to determine if the algorithm has converged and remained in the converged state since it started processing data.</p> <p>Initially, the AEC algorithm sets the three lower bits to 0 for the uninitialized state (<see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.AcousticEchoCancelStatus.HistoryUninitialized"/>). When the AEC algorithm has converged, the convergence history is switched to the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.AcousticEchoCancelStatus.HistoryContinuouslyConverged"/> state. If the AEC algorithm ever loses convergence, the convergence history is then transitioned to the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.AcousticEchoCancelStatus.HistoryPreviouslyDiverged"/> state. A transition from <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.AcousticEchoCancelStatus.HistoryUninitialized"/> to <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.AcousticEchoCancelStatus.HistoryPreviouslyDiverged"/> is also possible. The convergence history remains in the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.AcousticEchoCancelStatus.HistoryPreviouslyDiverged"/> state until the algorithm is reset or timely data is no longer arriving on the capture or render stream.</p>

            <summary>	
            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectSound.SoundBufferDescription"/> structure describes the characteristics of a new buffer object. It is used by theIDirectSound8::CreateSoundBuffermethod and by theDirectSoundFullDuplexCreate8function.<p>An earlier version of this structure, DSBUFFERDESC1, is maintained in Dsound.h for compatibility with DirectX 7 and earlier.</p>	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>When creating a primary buffer, applications must set the dwBufferBytes member to zero. DirectSound will determine the best buffer size for the particular sound device in use. To determine the size of a created primary buffer, call IDirectSoundBuffer8::GetCaps.</p> <p>The DSBCAPS_CTRLDEFAULT flag is no longer supported. This flag was defined as <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlPan"/> | <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlVolume"/> | <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlFrequency"/>. By specifying only the flags you need, you cut down on unnecessary resource usage.</p> <p>On VXD drivers, a sound buffer created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlPositionNotify"/> is always a software buffer, because the VXD driver model does not support notifications. With WDM drivers, a notification-enabled buffer can be in hardware, if hardware resources are available.</p> <p>The <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Hardware"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Software"/> flags are optional and mutually exclusive. <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Hardware"/> forces the buffer to reside in hardware, meaning that it will be mixed by the sound card. <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Software"/> forces the buffer to reside in software, where it is mixed by the CPU. These flags are also defined for the dwFlags member <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferCapabilities"/>.</p> <p>The 3D algorithms represent selection of the software emulation layer only: that is, the software algorithm that is used when no hardware is present for acceleration. In order to maximize hardware utilization, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> is treated as a special case. If no free 3D hardware voices are available, the buffer is then treated as a 2D buffer, but with 3D control. Specifically, when a sound buffer is created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/>, or when the buffer is played if the buffer was created with DSBPLAY_LOCDEFER, the following procedure is followed:</p> <ol> <li><p>If a free hardware 3D voice is available, that 3D hardware voice is used.</p></li> <li><p>If no free hardware 3D voices are available and a 2D hardware voice is available, that 2D hardware voice will be used. This is possible because the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> algorithm is a simple stereo pan algorithm</p></li> <li><p>If no free 2D or 3D hardware voices are available, the voice will be played in software using the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> algorithm.</p></li> </ol> <p>If a speaker configuration other than <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.SpeakerConfiguration.Headphone"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.SpeakerConfiguration.Stereo"/> is in effect, the processing will be done as if for a two-speaker configuration.</p> <p>If a buffer is created using one of the HRTF algorithms, and the HRTF algorithm is not available on the system (for example, a non-WDM system), a success code, DS_NO_VIRTUALIZATION, is returned. The sound buffer created will use <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> instead. For this reason, applications should use the SUCCEEDED or FAILED macros rather than checking explicitly for DS_OK when calling CreateSoundBuffer.</p>
