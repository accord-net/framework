            <remarks>	
            <p>Some audio cards may be unable to report accurately the number of available or free hardware buffers. This can happen, for example, when the card can play more sounds at lower sampling rates than at higher rates. In general, a nonzero value in any of the members relating to number of free hardware buffers signifies that at least one hardware resource of the appropriate type is available.</p> <p>The unlock transfer rate for software buffers is 0, because the data need not be transferred anywhere. Similarly, the play processing overhead for hardware buffers is 0 because the mixing is done by the sound device.</p>

If the lock does wrap, ppvAudioBytes2 points to the beginning of the buffer.</p> <p>If the application passes <c>null</c> for the ppvAudioPtr2 and pdwAudioBytes2 parameters, the lock extends no further than the end of the buffer and does not wrap.</p> <p>The application should read data from the references returned by this method and then immediately call Unlock. The sound buffer should not remain locked while it is running; if it does, the capture cursor will reach the locked bytes and audio problems may result.</p>

If the volume stays the same (even if you explicitly set the same volume in the duplicated buffer with a IDirectSoundBuffer8::SetVolume call), the buffer will play at full volume regardless.

            <summary>	
            <p>The KSPROPERTY_AEC_STATUS property is used to monitor the status of an AEC node (<strong>KSNODETYPE_ACOUSTIC_ECHO_CANCEL</strong>). This is an optional property of an AEC node.</p>	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>The three least significant bits in the AEC status flags (see preceding table) represent the convergence history (CH) of the AEC algorithm. The CH status bits can be used by a Microsoft DirectSound application to determine whether the algorithm has converged and also whether it has remained in the converged state since the time that it started processing data. Depending on the audio hardware, the AEC algorithm might fail to converge, in which case the resulting capture buffer is likely to include the echo from the speakers. </p><p>When the filter containing the AEC node is created or the node is reset, the AEC algorithm initially sets the three CH status bits to zero. This setting represents the uninitialized state, AEC_STATUS_FD_HISTORY_UNINITIALIZED.</p><p>After the AEC algorithm converges, the CH status switches to the converged state, AEC_STATUS_FD_HISTORY_CONTINUOUSLY_CONVERGED. If the AEC algorithm ever loses convergence, the CH status switches to the diverged state, AEC_STATUS_FD_HISTORY_PREVIOUSLY_DIVERGED. Although the status is most likely to switch to the diverged state from the converged state, it might also switch directly from the uninitialized state to the diverged state. After the CH status has switched to the diverged state, it will remain in that state until the algorithm is reset or starvation is detected.</p><p>When the AEC system filter detects starvation at any of its four pins--capture in, capture out, render in, or render out--it resets its internal state, including the convergence history. </p><p>Note that bit 2 of the three CH status bits is not currently used.</p><p>As an alternative to using the CH status bits, the application can monitor the real-time convergence status by checking the AEC_STATUS_FD_CURRENTLY_CONVERGED flag bit. If this bit is set, the algorithm is currently converged. The algorithm can lose convergence temporarily when changes occur in the acoustic path. The real-time convergence flag is filtered to prevent such momentary losses from inappropriately switching the CH status bits to the DSCFX_AEC_STATUS_FD_HISTORY_PREVIOUSLY_DIVERGED state.</p>

            <p>Some audio cards may be unable to report accurately the number of available or free hardware buffers. This can happen, for example, when the card can play more sounds at lower sampling rates than at higher rates. In general, a nonzero value in any of the members relating to number of free hardware buffers signifies that at least one hardware resource of the appropriate type is available.</p> <p>The unlock transfer rate for software buffers is 0, because the data need not be transferred anywhere. Similarly, the play processing overhead for hardware buffers is 0 because the mixing is done by the sound device.</p>

            <p>For secondary sound buffers, IDirectSoundBuffer8::Stop sets the play cursor to the sample that follows the last sample played. This means that when the Play method is next called on the buffer, it will continue playing where it left off.</p> <p>For the primary buffer, if an application has the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.CooperativeLevel.WritePrimary"/> level, this method will stop the buffer and reset the play cursor to 0 (the beginning of the buffer). This is necessary because the primary buffers on most sound cards can play only from the beginning of the buffer.</p> <p>However, if IDirectSoundBuffer8::Stop is called on a primary buffer and the application has a cooperative level other than <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.CooperativeLevel.WritePrimary"/>, this method simply reverses the effects of IDirectSoundBuffer8::Play. It configures the primary buffer to stop if no secondary buffers are playing. If other buffers are playing in this or other applications, the primary buffer will not actually stop until they are stopped. This method is useful because playing the primary buffer consumes processing overhead even if the buffer is playing sound data with the amplitude of 0 decibels.</p>

            <summary>	
            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectSound.SoundBufferDescription"/> structure describes the characteristics of a new buffer object. It is used by theIDirectSound8::CreateSoundBuffermethod and by theDirectSoundFullDuplexCreate8function.<p>An earlier version of this structure, DSBUFFERDESC1, is maintained in Dsound.h for compatibility with DirectX 7 and earlier.</p>	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>When creating a primary buffer, applications must set the dwBufferBytes member to zero. DirectSound will determine the best buffer size for the particular sound device in use. To determine the size of a created primary buffer, call IDirectSoundBuffer8::GetCaps.</p> <p>The DSBCAPS_CTRLDEFAULT flag is no longer supported. This flag was defined as <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlPan"/> | <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlVolume"/> | <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlFrequency"/>. By specifying only the flags you need, you cut down on unnecessary resource usage.</p> <p>On VXD drivers, a sound buffer created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlPositionNotify"/> is always a software buffer, because the VXD driver model does not support notifications. With WDM drivers, a notification-enabled buffer can be in hardware, if hardware resources are available.</p> <p>The <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Hardware"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Software"/> flags are optional and mutually exclusive. <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Hardware"/> forces the buffer to reside in hardware, meaning that it will be mixed by the sound card. <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Software"/> forces the buffer to reside in software, where it is mixed by the CPU. These flags are also defined for the dwFlags member <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferCapabilities"/>.</p> <p>The 3D algorithms represent selection of the software emulation layer only: that is, the software algorithm that is used when no hardware is present for acceleration. In order to maximize hardware utilization, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> is treated as a special case. If no free 3D hardware voices are available, the buffer is then treated as a 2D buffer, but with 3D control. Specifically, when a sound buffer is created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/>, or when the buffer is played if the buffer was created with DSBPLAY_LOCDEFER, the following procedure is followed:</p> <ol> <li><p>If a free hardware 3D voice is available, that 3D hardware voice is used.</p></li> <li><p>If no free hardware 3D voices are available and a 2D hardware voice is available, that 2D hardware voice will be used. This is possible because the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> algorithm is a simple stereo pan algorithm</p></li> <li><p>If no free 2D or 3D hardware voices are available, the voice will be played in software using the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> algorithm.</p></li> </ol> <p>If a speaker configuration other than <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.SpeakerConfiguration.Headphone"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.SpeakerConfiguration.Stereo"/> is in effect, the processing will be done as if for a two-speaker configuration.</p> <p>If a buffer is created using one of the HRTF algorithms, and the HRTF algorithm is not available on the system (for example, a non-WDM system), a success code, DS_NO_VIRTUALIZATION, is returned. The sound buffer created will use <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> instead. For this reason, applications should use the SUCCEEDED or FAILED macros rather than checking explicitly for DS_OK when calling CreateSoundBuffer.</p>
